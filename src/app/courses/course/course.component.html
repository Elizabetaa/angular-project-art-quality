        <h2> How the Specialization Works</h2>
        <h3>Take Courses</h3>
        <p>A ArtQuality Specialization is a series of courses that helps you master a skill. To begin, enroll in the
            Specialization directly, or review its courses and choose the one you'd like to start with. When you
            subscribe
            to a course that is part of a Specialization, you’re automatically subscribed to the full Specialization.
            It’s
            okay to complete just one course — you can pause your learning or end your subscription at any time. Visit
            your
            learner dashboard to track your course enrollments and your progress.</p>

        <h3>Hands-on Project</h3>
        <p> Every Specialization includes a hands-on project. You'll need to successfully finish the project(s) to
            complete
            the Specialization and earn your certificate. If the Specialization includes a separate course for the
            hands-on
            project, you'll need to finish each of the other courses before you can start it.</p>

        <h3>Earn a Certificate</h3>
        <p>When you finish every course and complete the hands-on project, you'll earn a Certificate that you can share
            with prospective employers and your professional network.</p>
