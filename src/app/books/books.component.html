            <h1>Essential Art History Books for Putting It All into Perspective</h1>
            <p>Like history in general, art history is subject to recurrent revisions and reappraisals. Whether it
                    occurs within their lifetimes or posthumously, some artists earn a place in the art-historical
                    record,
                    only to be forgotten and written out of the same . . . until and unless they are eventually
                    rediscovered. Art history, in other words, is a malleable discipline, but understanding developments
                    in
                    art depends on it—or at the very least is enhanced by it. Accordingly, we’ve assembled a list of
                    books,
                    both mainstream and specialized, that span the saga of art from classical antiquity to the present.
                    Whether you’re an artist or lover of art, you might want at least a few of them on your bookshelf.
